  goals: <p>2nd Street Outpost wanted an ecommerce website that was connected to their in store point of sale and inventory. The site needed to be set up in a short time frame and be have an easy to update store front. The store front was required to house all of their products and give the customer ease of purchase no matter if it was for in-store pickup, local delivery, or shipped.</p>,
  stackExplained: <p>I decided to go with Shopfiy for this project. After researching through many blogs, articles, and reviews it seemed to be the best all in one fit. It made the development side a breeze with the ability to us a premade theme and add additional custom code using the Shopify's templating language Liquid. That combined with their point of sale and inventory systems made having it all in one place a no brainer.</p>,
  challenges: <p>I ran into a few challenges initially with the shopify site. With it being my first dive into shopify I had to become familiar with how things are set up including products and themes as well as its limitations. After learning some of liquid and the schema behind how shopify stores data I was quickly able to start making custom sections in liquid.</p>,
  takeaways: <p>My takeaways from this project are mostly mixed. Iâ€™m happy I went with Shopify for the ecommerce and point of sale platform as it still seems to be the best on the market. However I was not impressed with the site speed performance. Using a free starter theme and a few custom sections I was hoping for better results, so in the future I might look into other frontend options. Such as purchasing a more optimized theme, building my own custom theme, or move to Gatsby JS with the Shopify Store front API.</p>
